The architecture should support:\n- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure\n- Testability\n- Flexibility to change implementations\n- Easy onboarding for new developers\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will implement a layered architecture with three main layers:\n1. **API Layer**: FastAPI routes, request/response handling\n2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and use cases\n3. **Repository Layer**: Data access with Unit of Work pattern\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive\n- Clear separation of concerns\n- Business logic isolated from framework and database\n- Easy to test each layer independently\n- Repository pattern allows switching data sources\n- Follows clean architecture principles\n\n### Negative\n- More boilerplate code compared to simple CRUD\n- Steeper learning curve for developers new to pattern\n- May seem over-engineered for simple operations\n",
